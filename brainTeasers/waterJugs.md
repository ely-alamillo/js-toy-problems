You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

i would fill both the 3 and 5 quart jugs at the same time and stop the water flow when the 3
quart jug is full. Now the 5 quart jug has 3 quarts and the 3 quart jug is filled. Then, i will pour
out the 3 quart jug in the 5 quart jug until it is filled. Now my 3 quart jug is left with 1 quart. Now
i empty the 5 quart jug and pour the 1 quart from the 3 quart jug. Finally, i will fill the 3 quart jug
and then pour it in the 5 quart jug that currently has one quart and i will end up with 4 quarts in the 5 quart jug.
