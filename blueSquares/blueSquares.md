### Getting back to our Front End roots

#### The purpose here is to hit the brakes a bit and go back to Front End Development before moving onto more involved backend concepts.

* Hint: Have fun :)

Create an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a script.js file.

Add jQuery to your application.  You can use either a CDN or you can download the script file and place it in this folder.

Use HTML/CSS (You can use flexbox) to display 12 red squares on the page.

Use jQuery to make it so that when you click on one of the red boxes that box turns blue.
